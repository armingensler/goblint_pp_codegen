Note that this requires a modified CIL library which can handle the GOBLINT_PP_VAR_ tokens and generate C code out of it. You can get it at: https://github.com/armingensler/cil/tree/goblint_pp

This will typically not be the version of CIL installed by default in the system. Because of this, a custom secondary install of this library is adviced. To do so, checkout the repository above (branch = goblint_pp) and just use "make" and not "make install" inside the checked out librtary. when building CIL is the easiest way to do this.

The "cilpath" variable in the Makefile has to be adjusted to where the CIL .cmi and .cmx files can be found. This should be the lib/cil/ subdirectory of the repository.
